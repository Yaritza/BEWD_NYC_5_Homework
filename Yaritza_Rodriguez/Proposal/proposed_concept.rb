# Concept: USPS mailbox (post-office) locator app

# To be made to fulfill the following criteria:

# 1. Works off the USPS API to retrieve
#      *mailbox addresses
#      *mailbox pick-up times
#      *May also include post-office locations and hours for further
 #        user convinience
# 2. Uses Google maps to search for those mailbox addresses using
#      *a zip code
#      *any address
#      *or user's GPS location via your mobile device
# 3. App will also suggest mailbox locations along suggested travel routes, given
#     a users start location (eg. home)  and their end destination (a medical appointment)
# 4. App needs to be mobile friendly for use on the go.
